# Deployment

The app is a single Next.js deployable. Every store credential is read inside a
request handler, so **the build needs no secrets** — CI proves this by building
without any.

## Pipeline

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | every push and PR | typecheck → lint → 112 unit tests → build with no secrets |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | after CI succeeds | deploys the default branch to production, every other branch to a preview URL |

Deploy runs on `workflow_run` after CI, so **a red build is never deployed**.
Without `VERCEL_TOKEN` set it logs a notice and skips, rather than failing.

If you would rather let Vercel drive deployments, delete `deploy.yml` and
connect the repository in the Vercel dashboard. That is simpler, but it deploys
on push regardless of whether tests passed.

## One-time setup

These steps need account access and credentials, so they have to be done by a
human — do not paste keys into a chat or a pull request.

### 1. Create the Vercel project

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel link          # from the repo root; creates .vercel/project.json
```

### 2. Set environment variables

In **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**, add each of the
following for Production *and* Preview. The names match `.env.example`:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Intent extraction and embeddings. Without it the app still works — explanations fall back to deterministic text. |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Full `mongodb+srv://` connection string. |
| `NEO4J_URI` | `neo4j+s://…` |
| `NEO4J_USER` | usually `neo4j` |
| `NEO4J_PASSWORD` | |
| `QDRANT_URL` | |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | |
| `EVIDENCE_SIGNING_SECRET` | HMAC key for evidence signatures, checked by `/verify/<id>`. Optional — a well-known dev key is used when unset, so set a real random value if shared evidence links need to be unforgeable. |
| `ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated emails allowed into `/admin`. Unset means the catalog is read-only for everyone. |

Optional tuning:

| Variable | Default | Why you might change it |
|---|---|---|
| `MONGODB_MAX_POOL_SIZE` | `10` | Each serverless instance keeps its own pool; lower it if Atlas reports connection pressure. |
| `MONGODB_DB` | `skillforge` | Point at a different database. |
| `DNS_SERVERS` | `8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1` | Only used by the local SRV workaround; ignored when it falls back. |

### 3. Allow Vercel to reach MongoDB Atlas

Serverless functions do not have stable outbound IPs, so **Atlas → Network
Access** must allow `0.0.0.0/0`, or you must enable a static-egress option.
Without this, every request that touches Mongo will time out in production
while working perfectly on your laptop.

Neo4j AuraDB and Qdrant Cloud accept connections from anywhere by default and
need no equivalent change.

### 4. Seed the stores

The seed scripts write to whatever the credentials point at, so run them once
against the same instances the deployment uses:

```bash
npm run db:seed:all     # graph → mongo → vector, in that order
npm run graph:verify    # asserts the prerequisite gate against the live graph
```

### 5. (Only if using `deploy.yml`) add GitHub secrets

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN` — from Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` — from `.vercel/project.json` after `vercel link`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` — same file

## Notes on running serverless

- **`middleware.ts` runs on the Edge runtime** and does a cookie-presence
  redirect only. It cannot reach Mongo; the real session check is
  `requireUserOrRedirect()` in pages and `requireUser()` in API routes, so a
  forged cookie is rejected there rather than at the edge.
- **Driver instances are cached on `globalThis`** so a warm function reuses its
  connection pool instead of opening a new one per invocation.
- **`mongodb+srv` resolution falls back.** The explicit-DNS path exists for a
  local resolver quirk; if it fails (a sandbox may block outbound DNS to a
  public resolver) the original SRV URI is handed to the driver instead. A
  warning is logged, and the connection still succeeds.
- **Every page is `force-dynamic`**, so nothing tries to reach a database at
  build time.
